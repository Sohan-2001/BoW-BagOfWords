The bag-of-words model is a simplifying representation used in natural language processing and information retrieval (IR). In this model, a text (such as a sentence or a document) is represented as the bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity. The bag-of-words model has also been used for computer vision.
The bag-of-words model is commonly used in methods of document classification where the (frequency of) occurrence of each word is used as a feature for training a classifier.
An early reference to "bag of words" in a linguistic context can be found in Zellig Harris's 1954 article on Distributional Structure.
The Bag-of-words model is one example of a Vector space model.
